# FLOWCHARTS  
  
## In this part of my technical interview, I was given these problems in Powerpoint. And I had to  
## use the given arrows and boxes to create a flowchart.
### P.S. The questions are not stated word for word because I am simply writing this from memory. 




1. Sum of 1 - 60 using a loop. (1 + 2 + 3 + ....... + 60)  




2. Largest number among int X, int Y and int Z without putting them in array like data structures.  
X, Y, Z are random numbers.  

3. Sort the numbers in int num[] in ascending order without using sort() or similar type of function that automatically sorts for you.  
Assume int N is the number of elements in num[].
