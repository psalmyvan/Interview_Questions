### Game Segments

A video game developer is developing a game in which the character makes their way through several segments of a level. In each segment, if the character collects a coin, the player scores a point. However, if a segment does not contain a coin, the player loses a point. Player 1 always begins the level, and, at some point, game play is turned over to Player 2 to complete the level. Player 1's goal is to achieve a higher score than Player 2 once the level is completed. Given the status of game segments(whether they contain a coin or not), determine the minimum number of segments Player 1 should play so that, in the end, their score is greater than Player 2's score.  


**Example**

*segments = [1, 1, 0, 1]*
